# GIFL ü´∞üíú

### PHP - Twig - JavaScript Vanilla - Sass - CSS - HTML

GIFL is an innovative project aimed at creating a user-friendly web platform for sharing, organizing, and discovering animated GIFs. It offers two main functionalities: a private space for registered users to upload, create, and modify GIF collections, and a public section where visitors can search and explore public collections available in the database.

This project was developed as part of the validation for the professional title of [web developer](https://www.francecompetences.fr/recherche/rncp/37674/). It represents a synthesis of skills acquired in web development, database management, and user interface design.
